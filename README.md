# Problem Statement

Segment the audience of a content app based on its userâ€™s propensity to watch a video in the next 2
days

# Data

The directory contains event details for a Video Content app. As the user engages with the app, some of
his actions are recorded in detail.
For example, as soon as the user launches the app, an "AppLaunched" event is recorded which contains
details such as timestamp, os, device, country, userId etc.
When the user registers itself for the app, a "Registered" event is raised. Similarly when he views the
details of a video or an episode, a "VideoDetails" event is recorded. Also, when he starts watching a
video, a "VideoStarted" event is raised.
Many a time, app owners also engage with the customers via Push Notifications, SMS, emails etc. When
a user clicks on any such campaign, a UTM Visited campaign is recorded. The details of all these events
are provided below in the "Events" section.
